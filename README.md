## Professional README Generator

## Overview

Created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to quickly create a README template by using the command-line application. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. 

Refer to the [Best README Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) by [Othneil Drew](https://github.com/othneildrew), as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.
